# Unsupervised-Learning

This repository contains implementations of several unsupervised learning techniques applied to different datasets:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction on the Breast Cancer dataset.

K-Means Clustering: Clustering on the make_blobs dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness on well-separated clusters.

Isolation Forest: Anomaly detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm.

DBSCAN: Clustering on the make_moons dataset to handle non-linearly separable data.

DBSCAN for Anomaly Detection: Identifying anomalies in the make_circles dataset using DBSCAN.
